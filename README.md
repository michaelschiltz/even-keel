## **“On an Even Keel”:  Silver Risk, Trade Finance,  and Hedging Strategies  around the Turn of the Twentieth Century**

### Introduction
Whereas the emergence of the classical gold standard (1870-1900) has attracted considerable attention in economic literature, only very few authors have inquired into the protracted confidence crisis of silver, which was the former’s corollary. Building on the results of authors as [Calomiris](	https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=282686), [Oppers](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3932(00)00032-5) and [Flandreau/Oosterlinck](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoneco.2012.09.001), this book project explores the evolution of management practice in (Western and Japanese) exchange banks in Asia. Using an approach that could arguably called ‘[forensic accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_accounting)’, it attempts not only to show that contemporaries were aware of the problems that were caused by the gyrations of the silver price, but that they also sought to actively remedy its harmful effects on trade between gold and silver using countries. We describe how experiment with financial instruments eventually led to success. 
Next, and contrary to the commonly held belief that nineteenth century bankers did not have a sophisticated understanding of hedging strategies, we show, in a quantitative way, that hedging strategies existed, and that they impacted banks’ operations in profound ways. More specifically, we use the mostly unexplored accounting data and archives of the [Yokohama Specie Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama_Specie_Bank) (*yokohama shōkin ginkō* [横濱正金銀行](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%A8%AA%E6%B5%9C%E6%AD%A3%E9%87%91%E9%8A%80%E8%A1%8C)) in order to describe the bank’s wrought management history in the tumultuous years around the turn of the twentieth century. YSB had to come to grips with Japan’s effort at adopting the gold standard (1897), the difficult expansionary ‘postbellum administration’ (*sengo keiei* 戦後経営), and the early consolidation of the country’s imperialism (after the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05). All events would shape not only the bank’s operations and expansion in Asia, but also affect the organization of its branch network, and the management of its flow-of-funds.
