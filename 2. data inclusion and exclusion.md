# Flow data: Flow-of-fund (資金循環) analysis of an exchange bank branch network

> * A reconstruction of YSB’s flow-of-funds has been attempted by many others, with varying degrees of success. As indicated in the chapter "Making of the Database", Taira’s groundbreaking study is the first to bring a network theoretical understanding to YSB, but it unfortunately eliminated the data related to the interest bills (not included in the flow data for accounting reasons). As a matter of fact, he surmised that interest bills were listed in both `statement of loans and bills discounted` and the `statement on foreign exchange holdings and movements`. Hence, he omitted them from his analysis as it would otherwise amount to double-counting the data.

> * Ishii, on the other hand, has convincingly argued that the interest bill data *cannot* have been included in the statement on foreign exchange holdings and movements, as Japan’s trade deficit with Great-Britain in this period should in any case have resulted in very large transfers of funds from Great-Britain to Japan (as exports from Great-Britain to Japan would have been financed by bills bought in London and sent to Yokohama and Kobe for collection). Consequently, Taira’s analysis, which seems to show a reverse flow of funds from Japan to Great-Britain, must be mistaken. 
> * Yet another interpretation can be found in Bak (Park). In his view, interest bills functioned as remittances (*sōkin* 送金) of foreign exchange which were sent  by the branch/office in charge of collection (*toritate-ten* 取立店) to the branch/office that had purchased the bill (*kaitori-ten* 買取店). In other words, Bak believes that interest bills were a means of settling accounts between branches (in Japanese referred to as 'inter-branch remitting' (*kaikin* 回金) (as opposed to reimbursing)). In this view, including the interest bills in the flow of funds also amounts to double-counting, yet in a way different from Taira’s interpretation. However, as is clear from e.g. interest bills handled by the New York office, interest bills were *not necessarily* finance bills, i.e. they were also used for mercantile transactions.

> * **Important: Note that Ishii's intuitions have been confirmed by our dataset and visualizations**: it is only because we take into account the amounts of interest bills that our analysis arrives at the conclusion that an 'even keel' strategy existed. *If the data on interest bills would have been omitted, symmetries in amounts of bills bought and sold handled by the silver respectively gold branches would not have appeared.*

# Balance sheet data: stock data

> * in the Midterm reports of the Yokohama Specie Bank, stock data are generally included as follows:

| [name]   |          |          | 店名 branch name                             |
|----------|----------|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| z        | y        | x        | 種類 `type of entry`                         |
| [amount] | [amount] | [amount] | 前期繰越高 `carried over from last semester` |
| [amount] | [amount] | [amount] | 当期 [...]高 `[acquired] this semester`      |
| [amount] | [amount] | [amount] | 当期 [...]高 `[paid out] this semester`      |
| [amount] | [amount] | [amount] | 差引き現在高 `amount on hand; current amount` |

>> * remarks: as is the convention in prewar Japanese, the table is to be read **from right to left**.

> * as a rule, our database only notes the mounts of the last category, i.e. 「差引き現在高」, or `amounts on hand` for the semester in question. As the reader will understand, it expresses (`carried over from last semester` + `[acquired] this semester` - `[paid out] this semester`).
