### Flow-of-fund analysis of an exchange bank branch network

> * A reconstruction of YSB’s flow-of-funds has been attempted by many others, with varying degrees of success. As indicated in the chapter "Making of the Database", Taira’s groundbreaking study is the first to bring a network theoretical understanding to YSB, but it unfortunately eliminated the data related to the interest bills (not included in the flow data for accounting reasons). Because the amount of interest bills is substantial, his analysis is not only mistaken with respect to the weight of transfers, but also with respect to their direction.
