## A. Flow-of-funds Analysis

### Data structure

1. how to calculate the flow of funds amount from (generic) branch X to (generic) branch Y:

Table 1.

| bill type    | specifics             | amounts | calculations                                                    |
|--------------|-----------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| bills sold   | bills of exchange     |       a | (c + d) - (a + b)                                               |
|              | telegraphic transfers |       b | amount of interest bills (d)                                    |
| bills bought | bills of exchange     |       c | ((c + d) - (a + b)) + d                                         |
|              | telegraphic transfers |       d | conversions of (((c + d) - (a + b)) + d) into Japanese yen (JPY)|

#### Notes:
> * the above formula `(c + d) - (a + b)` is the standard formula for calculating the flow-of-funds from one branch to another.
> * the `amount of interest bills (d)` is optional, i.e. is typically zero for flows among most branches, and this for a good reason: typically, interest bills were only sent from liquid centers to liquidity-poor peripheral markets, and this (mostly, but not exclusively) because of their role as finance  bills rather than as bills that contained an underlying trade ('real') transaction. One typically finds them as sent from London or New York to Yokohama, Kobe (to a lesser degree), and Shanghai.
> * `((c + d) - (a + b)) + d` speaks for itself: it is the extended version of the above noted formula `(c + d) - (a + b)`, in that it adds interest bills as contracts signifying yet another *positive* flow of funds from branch X to branch Y.
> * the value for the formula `conversions of (((c + d) - (a+ b)) + d) into Japanese yen (JPY)` is important, as it will be used and compared with the value of funds sent from branch Y to branch X; the difference between the two determines the relative exchange position of the branches *vis-a-vis* each other.



2. Consequently, a adjacency matrix for a a generic branch network with branches X,Y,Z at a point in time t1 looks as follows:

Table 2.

|   | X  |     |       |   | Y  |     |        |   | Z  |     |      |   |
|---|----|-----|-------|---|----|-----|--------|---|----|-----|------|---|
| **X** | BS | b/e |    -   |  - | BS | b/e | a      |   | BS | b/e | a’   |   |
|   |    | TT  |   -    |  - |    | TT  | b      |   |    | TT  | b’   |   |
|   | BB | b/e |   -   |  - | BB | b/e | c      |   | BB | b/e | c’   |   |
|   |    | TT  |   -   |  - |    | TT  | d      |   |    | TT  | d’   |   |
| **Y** | BS | b/e | a’’   |   | BS | b/e |    -    |  - | BS | b/e | a’’’ |   |
|   |    | TT  | b’’   |   |    | TT  |    -    |  - |    | TT  | b’’’ |   |
|   | BB | b/e | c’’   |   | BB | b/e |    -   |  - | BB | b/e | c’’’ |   |
|   |    | TT  | d’’   |   |    | TT  |    -    |  - |    | TT  | d’’’ |   |
| **Z** | BS | b/e | a’’’’ |   | BS | b/e | a’’’’’ |   | BS | b/e |   -   |  - |
|   |    | TT  | b’’’’ |   |    | TT  | b’’’’’ |   |    | TT  |   -   |  - |
|   | BB | b/e | c’’’’ |   | BB | b/e | c’’’’’ |   | BB | b/e |   -   |  - |
|   |    | TT  | d’’’’ |   |    | TT  | d’’’’’ |   |    | TT  |   -   |  - |

#### Notes:
> * for obvious reasons, branches cannot send amounts to themselves. Therefore, these cells jave been filled with `-`.
> * as in the above table, amounts sent are expressed by means of generic letters, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `a'`, `b'` etc.
> * The direction is important: it must be remembered that in network analysis, by convention, the direction goes from from the rows to the columns. Hence, the flow from X to Y, which we generically defined as `a` in table 1 can now be found as `a` in the second row, third column, under Y; vice versa, the flows from Y to X, 3 can be found as `a''`, `b''`, etc. on row 3, column 2, under X



3. An important **methodological novelty** of the book is *the introduction of a measure by means of which we express not only the relative exchange position of a branch vis-a-vis another one, but also vis-a-vis the whole branch network*. We can achieve this by calculating the total amount of `bills sold` a branch sends on to all other branches (i.e. `SUM2`), and deduct that from the total amount of `bills bought` it send on to all other branches (`SUM1`). This can be done for all points in time `t1`, `t2`, `t3`, etc. Calculating the exchange position of branch X in a simple 3-branch network (X, Y, Z) at time t1 can be done as follows:

|       | X                                    | Y                                     | Z                                     |                      |
|-------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **X** |                                      | X→Y : (bills bought minus bills sold) | X→Z : (bills bought minus bills sold) | **SUM1:(X→Y)+(X→Z)** |
| **Y** | Y→X: (bills bought minus bills sold) |                                       | Y→Z: (bills bought minus bills sold)  |                      |
| **Z** | Z→X: (bills bought minus bills sold) | Z→Y: (bills bought minus bills sold)  |                                       |                      |
|       | **SUM2:(Y→X)+(Z→X)**                 |                                       |                                       |                      |


4. Having calculated the exchange position of *every* branch vis-a-vis the branch network at *all* points in time, we can proceed with a **time series**:

|       | t1                  | t2  | t3  | ... |
|-------|---------------------|-----|-----|-----|
| **X** | (X→Y+X→Z)-(Y→X+Z→X) | ... | ... |     |
| **Y** | (Y→X+Y→Z)-(X→Y+Z→Y) | ... | ... |     |
| **Z** | (Z→X+Z→Y)-(X→Z+Y→Z) | ... | ... |     |

The latter's visualization is graph 1 (below)

### Ethnographic relevance

> * when plotting, in a time series, the differential between a) funds sent from X to Y and b) funds sent from Y to X, we inadvertently *yet consciously* point out the *necessary* existence of a 'negative' exchange position of certain branches versus others (either X or Y) and, by extension, the possibility of a negative exchange position of a certain branch *vis-a-vis* the aggregated branch network. This may seem obvious and, indeed, *it is*: bankers at the time complained relentlessly about certain branches that they considered to be chronic 'withdrawers' of funds. In the vocabulary and thinking of social network analysis (SNA), however, it is not that simple. As the theory stands now, SNA does not easily accept the possibility of 'negative flows' (as, for instance, in the case of a banking customer using an overdraft facility with his local bank). In the book manuscript, I thought it to be important to be true to the contemporary problem awareness, and have attempted to allow the possibility of negative flows in the analysis and visualizations. See graph 1 below.

### Rounding

> * importantly, amounts were rounded *to the ones*. This is quite different from earlier analyses, which chose to round to the thousands. In itself, however, it was the only way to come to conclusive findings with respect to the question whether hedging strategies were effectively adopted or not.

### Conversions into Japanese yen

> * Exchange rates were taken from the  "Historical statistics - Exchange rates" page of the Bank of Japan, http://www.imes.boj.or.jp/hstat/data/ferdd/index.html; this page contains both a data source (in .CSV), and an [explanatory note](http://www.imes.boj.or.jp/hstat/data/ferdd/note_ferdd.html); see [here for English](http://www.imes.boj.or.jp/english/hstat/data/ferdd/note_ferdd.html)
> * I have used the monthly average value as base for calculations (unfortunately, end-of-month rates are not included in the BOJ database)
