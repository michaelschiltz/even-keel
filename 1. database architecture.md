1. how to calculate the flow of funds amount from (generic) branch X to (generic) branch Y:

| bill type    | specifics             | amounts | calculations                                                    |
|--------------|-----------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| bills sold   | bills of exchange     |       a | (c + d) - (a+ b)                                                |
|              | telegraphic transfers |       b | amount of interest bills (d)                                    |
| bills bought | bills of exchange     |       c | ((c + d) - (a+ b)) + d                                          |
|              | telegraphic transfers |       d | conversions of (((c + d) - (a+ b)) + d) into Japanese yen (JPY) |

Notes:
> * the above formula `(c + d) - (a+ b)` is the standard formula for calculating the flow-of-funds from one branch to another
> * the `amount of interest bills (d)` is optional; typically, interest bills were only sent from liquid centers to liquidity-poor peripheral markets, and this because of their role as finance  bills rather than as bills which contained an underlying trade ('real') transaction
