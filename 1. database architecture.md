## A. Flow-of-funds Analysis

### Data structure

1. how to calculate the flow of funds amount from (generic) branch X to (generic) branch Y:

Table 1.

| bill type    | specifics             | amounts | calculations                                                    |
|--------------|-----------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| bills sold   | bills of exchange     |       a | (c + d) - (a + b)                                               |
|              | telegraphic transfers |       b | amount of interest bills (d)                                    |
| bills bought | bills of exchange     |       c | ((c + d) - (a + b)) + d                                         |
|              | telegraphic transfers |       d | conversions of (((c + d) - (a + b)) + d) into Japanese yen (JPY)|

#### Notes:
> * the above formula `(c + d) - (a + b)` is the standard formula for calculating the flow-of-funds from one branch to another.
> * the `amount of interest bills (d)` is optional, i.e. is typically zero for flows among most branches, and this for a good reason: typically, interest bills were only sent from liquid centers to liquidity-poor peripheral markets, and this (mostly, but not exclusively) because of their role as finance  bills rather than as bills that contained an underlying trade ('real') transaction. One typically finds them as sent from London or New York to Yokohama, Kobe (to a lesser degree), and Shanghai.
> * `((c + d) - (a + b)) + d` speaks for itself: it is the extended version of the above noted formula `(c + d) - (a + b)`, in that it adds interest bills as contracts signifying yet another *positive* flow of funds from branch X to branch Y.
> * the value for the formula `conversions of (((c + d) - (a+ b)) + d) into Japanese yen (JPY)` is important, as it will be used and compared with the value of funds sent from branch Y to branch X; the difference between the two determines the relative exchange position of the branches *vis-a-vis* each other.



2. Consequently, a adjacency matrix for a a generic branch network with branches X,Y,Z at a point in time t1 looks as follows:

Table 2.

|   | X  |     |       |   | Y  |     |        |   | Z  |     |      |   |
|---|----|-----|-------|---|----|-----|--------|---|----|-----|------|---|
| **X** | BS | b/e |    -   |  - | BS | b/e | a      |   | BS | b/e | a’   |   |
|   |    | TT  |   -    |  - |    | TT  | b      |   |    | TT  | b’   |   |
|   | BB | b/e |   -   |  - | BB | b/e | c      |   | BB | b/e | c’   |   |
|   |    | TT  |   -   |  - |    | TT  | d      |   |    | TT  | d’   |   |
| **Y** | BS | b/e | a’’   |   | BS | b/e |    -    |  - | BS | b/e | a’’’ |   |
|   |    | TT  | b’’   |   |    | TT  |    -    |  - |    | TT  | b’’’ |   |
|   | BB | b/e | c’’   |   | BB | b/e |    -   |  - | BB | b/e | c’’’ |   |
|   |    | TT  | d’’   |   |    | TT  |    -    |  - |    | TT  | d’’’ |   |
| **Z** | BS | b/e | a’’’’ |   | BS | b/e | a’’’’’ |   | BS | b/e |   -   |  - |
|   |    | TT  | b’’’’ |   |    | TT  | b’’’’’ |   |    | TT  |   -   |  - |
|   | BB | b/e | c’’’’ |   | BB | b/e | c’’’’’ |   | BB | b/e |   -   |  - |
|   |    | TT  | d’’’’ |   |    | TT  | d’’’’’ |   |    | TT  |   -   |  - |

#### Notes:
> * for obvious reasons, branches cannot send amounts to themselves (so-called 'self-loops'). Therefore, these cells have been filled with `-`.
> * as in the above table, amounts sent are expressed by means of generic letters, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `a'`, `b'` etc.
> * The direction is important: it must be remembered that in network analysis, by convention, the direction goes from from the rows to the columns. Hence, the flow from X to Y, which we generically defined as `a` in table 1 can now be found as `a` in the second row, third column, under Y; vice versa, the flows from Y to X, 3 can be found as `a''`, `b''`, etc. on row 6, column 4, under X.



3. An important **methodological novelty** of the book is *the introduction of a measure by means of which we express not only the relative exchange position of a branch vis-a-vis another one, but also vis-a-vis the whole branch network*. We can achieve this by calculating the total amount of `bills sold` a branch sends on to all other branches (i.e. `SUM2`), and deduct that from the total amount of `bills bought` it send on to all other branches (`SUM1`). This can be done for all points in time `t1`, `t2`, `t3`, etc. Calculating the exchange position of branch X in a simple 3-branch network (X, Y, Z) at time t1 can be done as follows:

|       | X                                    | Y                                     | Z                                     |                      |
|-------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **X** |                                      | X→Y : (bills bought minus bills sold) | X→Z : (bills bought minus bills sold) | **SUM1:(X→Y)+(X→Z)** |
| **Y** | Y→X: (bills bought minus bills sold) |                                       | Y→Z: (bills bought minus bills sold)  |                      |
| **Z** | Z→X: (bills bought minus bills sold) | Z→Y: (bills bought minus bills sold)  |                                       |                      |
|       | **SUM2:(Y→X)+(Z→X)**                 |                                       |                                       |                      |


4. Having calculated the exchange position of *every* branch vis-a-vis the branch network at *all* points in time, we can proceed with a **time series**:

|       | t1                  | t2  | t3  | ... |
|-------|---------------------|-----|-----|-----|
| **X** | (X→Y+X→Z)-(Y→X+Z→X) | ... | ... |     |
| **Y** | (Y→X+Y→Z)-(X→Y+Z→Y) | ... | ... |     |
| **Z** | (Z→X+Z→Y)-(X→Z+Y→Z) | ... | ... |     |

The latter's visualization is graph 1 (below)

### Ethnographic relevance

> * when plotting, in a time series, the differential between a) funds sent from X to Y and b) funds sent from Y to X, we inadvertently *yet consciously* point out the *necessary* existence of a 'negative' exchange position of certain branches versus others (either X or Y) and, by extension, the possibility of a negative exchange position of a certain branch *vis-a-vis* the aggregated branch network. This may seem obvious and, indeed, *it is*: bankers at the time complained relentlessly about certain branches that they considered to be chronic 'withdrawers' of funds. In the vocabulary and thinking of social network analysis (SNA), however, it is not that simple. As the theory stands now, SNA does not easily accept the possibility of 'negative flows' (as, for instance, in the case of a banking customer using an overdraft facility with his local bank). In the book manuscript, I thought it to be important to be true to the contemporary problem awareness, and have attempted to allow the possibility of negative flows in the analysis and visualizations. See graph 1 below.

### Rounding

> * importantly, amounts were rounded *to the ones*. This is quite different from earlier analyses, which chose to round to the thousands. In itself, however, it was the only way to come to conclusive findings with respect to the question whether hedging strategies were effectively adopted or not.

### Conversions into Japanese yen

> * Exchange rates were taken from the  "Historical statistics - Exchange rates" page of the Bank of Japan, http://www.imes.boj.or.jp/hstat/data/ferdd/index.html; this page contains both a data source (in .CSV), and an [explanatory note](http://www.imes.boj.or.jp/hstat/data/ferdd/note_ferdd.html); see [here for English](http://www.imes.boj.or.jp/english/hstat/data/ferdd/note_ferdd.html)
> * I have used the monthly average value as base for calculations (unfortunately, end-of-month rates are not included in the BOJ database)

## B. Interest Bills

A particular point of attention must be reserved for the so-called `interest bills`, or *ritsuki tegata* 利付手形. For a host of reasons, they pose some serious interpretative hurdles for the financial historian. Concretely, these bills were, at least for the period 1898-1908, not included in the Midterm Reports’ flow data, but treated as a particular category under `statement of loans and bills discounted` (*kashikin oyobi tegata waribiki no koto* 貸金及ビ手形割引ノ事). This exclusion from the `statement of the amount of bills sent and received` has caused considerable misunderstandings among students of Yokohama Specie Bank foreign exchange operations. 

> * Notably Taira, who pioneered the network approach to YSB flow-of-funds, surmised that interest bills were listed in both ‘statement of loans and bills discounted’ and the ‘statement on foreign exchange holdings and movements’. Hence, he omitted them from his analysis as it would otherwise amount to double-counting the data. Ishii, on the other hand, has convincingly argued that the interest bill data cannot have been included in the statement on foreign exchange holdings and movements, as Japan’s trade deficit with Great-Britain in this period should in any case have resulted in very large transfers of funds from Great-Britain to Japan (as exports from Great-Britain to Japan would have been financed by bills bought in London and sent to Yokohama and Kobe for collection). Consequently, Taira’s analysis, which seems to show a reverse flow of funds from Japan to Great-Britain, must be mistaken. 
> * Yet another interpretation can be found in Bak (Park). In his view, interest bills functioned as remittances (*sōkin* 送金) of foreign exchange which were sent  by the branch/office in charge of collection (*toritate-ten* 取立店) to the branch/office that had purchased the bill (*kaitori-ten* 買取店). In other words, Bak believes that interest bills were a means of settling (squaring) accounts between branches (in Japanese referred to as remitting (*kaikin* 回金) (as opposed to reimbursing)). In this view, including the interest bills in the flow of funds also amounts to double-counting, yet in a way different from Taira’s interpretation. However, as is clear from e.g. interest bills handled by the New York office, *interest bills were also used for trade transactions*.
> * Based on Nishimura's early discussion (see the description in the book), we suspect that their classification under `statement of loans and bills discounted` hints to their nature as finance bills rather than bills designating an underlying trade transaction.
> * The consequences of such conjecture may be profound. As we point out in the book, it hints to the existence of a late nineteenth century carry trade. We possess at least descriptive evidence of the latter:
>> "For bills related to East-Asia, one bookkeeping manual from 1907 provides the following narrative evidence: “The interest rate in London is, on average, between 3 and 4 per cent. [The international exchange banks] there purchase ‘Eastern bills’ [i.e. interest bills] on India, China and Japan. Given that the interest [on the latter] is normally around 6%, and given that they purchase Eastern bills by means of low-interest London funds, they are obviously running a very profitable business.” This was certainly so after the Russo-Japanese War. According to the same source: “The interest on interest bills to East-Asia is normally 6%, but last year, due to problems in Russo-Japanese relations, the rate was increased to 7%”. In other words, even when estimating the yearly cost of London acceptance credit to be around 5% in the 1900s, arbitraging must have been a lucrative affair. And indeed, the share of interest bills in the total ‘bills sent’ portfolio of YSB London is very high (consistently more than 60% after 1898)." 石川由郎. 1907. “英国為替銀行ニ関スル復命書”. 三井銀行. P. 67; p. 76.

Yoshiwara Tatsuno has focused on the fact that interest bills were not only sent from liquid centers to non-liquid regions, but also *among liquid centers*. This is an element that I have left out of the database because these amounts are dwarfed by the former (esp. interest bills sent from London to Japan). He may, however, have a point. At least the *Economist* mentions the role of finance bills arriving from France and NY in the early twentieth century (see the book manuscript). Admittedly, it is not clear whether these finance bills were necessarily interest bills, but our conjecture in the book points to the plausibility hereof.
