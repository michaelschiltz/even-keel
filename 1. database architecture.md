### data structure

1. how to calculate the flow of funds amount from (generic) branch X to (generic) branch Y:

| bill type    | specifics             | amounts | calculations                                                    |
|--------------|-----------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| bills sold   | bills of exchange     |       a | (c + d) - (a + b)                                               |
|              | telegraphic transfers |       b | amount of interest bills (d)                                    |
| bills bought | bills of exchange     |       c | ((c + d) - (a + b)) + d                                         |
|              | telegraphic transfers |       d | conversions of (((c + d) - (a + b)) + d) into Japanese yen (JPY)|


## Notes:
> * the above formula `(c + d) - (a + b)` is the standard formula for calculating the flow-of-funds from one branch to another.
> * the `amount of interest bills (d)` is optional; typically, interest bills were only sent from liquid centers to liquidity-poor peripheral markets, and this because of their role as finance  bills rather than as bills that contained an underlying trade ('real') transaction.
> * `((c + d) - (a + b)) + d` speaks for itself: it is the extended version of the above noted formula `(c + d) - (a + b)`, in that it adds interest bills as contracts signifying yet another *positive* flow of funds from branch X to branch Y.
> * the value for the formula `conversions of (((c + d) - (a+ b)) + d) into Japanese yen (JPY)` is important, as it will be used and compared with the value of funds sent from branch Y to branch X; the difference between the two determines the relative exchange position of the branches *vis-a-vis* each other.

### conversions into Japanese yen

> * Exchange rates were taken from the  Â¨Historical statistics - Exchange rates" page of the Bank of Japan, http://www.imes.boj.or.jp/hstat/data/ferdd/index.html; this page contains both a data source (in .CSV), and an [explanatory note](http://www.imes.boj.or.jp/hstat/data/ferdd/note_ferdd.html); see [here for English](http://www.imes.boj.or.jp/english/hstat/data/ferdd/note_ferdd.html)
> * I have used the monthly average value as base for calculations
